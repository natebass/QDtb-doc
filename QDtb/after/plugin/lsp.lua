--- LSP support plugins.

--- 'autocomplete' (see lua/config/options.lua) drives the popup and already reaches the
--- server through the "o" flag in 'complete', so autotrigger stays off: it would be a
--- second, redundant trigger. Enabling the module is still required for everything that
--- happens *around* the menu -- resolving documentation into the "popup" window, and
--- applying an item's side effects on <C-y>: snippet expansion (lua_ls sends snippets
--- because of callSnippet = "Replace"), additional text edits such as auto-imports, and
--- any command the server attaches to the item.

-- NOTE: automatic signature help.
-- mini.completion used to open the signature float on its own after 50ms. Neovim 0.12 has
-- no option for that: the only built-in entry point is the default <C-s> mapping in Insert
-- mode (|i_CTRL-S|), which has to be pressed. Uncommenting the block below brings the old
-- behavior back. It hooks the characters the server itself nominates as signature
-- triggers -- lua_ls reports { "(", "," } -- and opens the same float <C-s> would.
-- `focus = false` keeps the cursor in the buffer, and vim.schedule defers to after the
-- character is actually inserted, because InsertCharPre fires beforehand and the server
-- would otherwise resolve the position one column short. Verified against lua_ls 3.19.0.
