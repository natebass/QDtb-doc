    The module manifest (.psd1) names this file as the root of the module.
    Private helpers load first so the public commands can rely on them.

    Paths are built with Join-Path rather than a literal separator: this module is
    developed on Linux Mint and a backslash there is a filename character, not a
    directory separator.
